    * I think this was the one that taught me about using the cursor
    * That is, when you need to position two objects exactly, first select a vertext & set the object's "center" there
    * Then select the second object, and do the same -- where the vertexes should meet
    * Move the cursor to the destination vertex 
    * Move the target object to the location of the cursor
    * (I think I'll get better at doing this, the more I do it.  The cursor is where new objects are generated, there's probably value in building your objects around this, the more you do it.)

## Difficult things I learned myself

* Oh sure, Blender can be set up to remember 256 steps... but the moment you save something, it forgets them all!
    * So, I built the bread-shelf support, out of 6 pieces.  I wanted to 3D print the first sample, so I saved it, then I Joined all the pieces together & exported it, *intending to undo the Join back into the individual pieces*... but when I hit Cntl-Z... Nothing!
